This is the first commit I am uploading directly from my Visual Studio Code

How cool is that ! We don't even need Github Desktop anymore ! we can directly pull the change from Github

and we can commit and push to github.com without leaving visual studio ! 

Cool

# This time I downloaded from the github directly into my VS code because my github desktop didn't work !
